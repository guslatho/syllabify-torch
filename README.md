'torch_train.ipynb' Is a sample setup for training a new torch model to perform syllabification. The torch training is language agnostic, meaning any language file can be input (currently only tested on languages using the latin alphabet).

To use either the Brandt algorithm or a pretrained torch model for syllabification, see 'sample_script.ipynb'.
